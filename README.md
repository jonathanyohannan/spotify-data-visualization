Spotify Data Visualizer is a web app where you can search for any track in the Spotify catalog and view:

1. The track's artwork, title, artist and album.
2. A preview of the track.
3. A waveform constructed by performing an audio analysis of the track's segments.
4. Values for the tracks's calculated audio features such as danceability, energy, valence, etc., along with a description of what each audio feature represents.

Spotify Data Visualizer is created in Python using the Dash framework. The spotipy Python library is used to authenticate with the Spotify Web API.
