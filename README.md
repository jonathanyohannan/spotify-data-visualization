The purpose of this personal project is to create a web app that accesses the Spotify API. Users can search for a track, and the web app will display:

1. A waveform constructed by performing an audio analysis of the track's segments.
2. Information on the tracks's calculated audio features such as danceability, valence, energy, and more.
